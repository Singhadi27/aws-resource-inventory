      # AWS Resource Inventory Script

      A shell scripting project that automates the process of listing all active resources in an AWS account.  
      This is a simple yet powerful tool for **DevOps engineers** and **cloud administrators** to quickly discover resources across different AWS services.  

      ---

      ## üéØ Project Overview
      This project is my **first shell scripting project** focused on **automation in DevOps**.  
      The script connects to AWS via the AWS CLI and lists resources for supported services in a given region.  

      üîπ Why this is useful:
      - Helps in **cost optimization** by discovering unused or forgotten resources.
      - Can be scheduled as a **cron job** for periodic monitoring.
      - Output can be redirected for **reporting or alerting** (e.g., email reports).

      ---

      ## üöÄ Features
      - Lists resources from multiple AWS services including:
        - EC2
        - RDS
        - S3
        - CloudFront
        - VPC
        - IAM
        - Route53
        - CloudWatch
        - CloudFormation
        - Lambda
        - SNS
        - SQS
        - DynamoDB
        - EBS
      - Uses only **AWS CLI** (no extra dependencies).
      - Clean error handling: checks for AWS CLI installation & configuration before running.
      - Easy-to-use command line interface.

      ## üìã Prerequisites
      Before running the script, make sure you have:

      1. **unzip** installed  
         ```bash
         sudo apt-get install unzip -y
         ```

      2. **AWS CLI** installed  
         [Download AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)  

      3. **AWS CLI configured** with credentials  
         - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí Click on your name ‚Üí Security Credentials  
         - Create an **Access Key** (Access Key ID + Secret Access Key).  
         - Run:
           ```bash
           aws configure
           ```
         - Provide Access Key, Secret Key, Region, and Output format.

      ---

      ## ‚ö° Usage
      ```bash
      ./aws_resource_list.sh <aws_region> <aws_service>
      ```

      ### Example:
      ```bash
      ./aws_resource_list.sh us-east-1 ec2
      ```
      This will list all EC2 instances in the `us-east-1` region.  
      You can replace the region and service as needed.

      ## üìå Notes
      - Some services like **S3** and **Route53** are **global services**, so the region flag may not apply.
      - You will find service-specific commands in the [AWS CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/).
      - Script can be extended to support **more AWS services**.

      ---

      ## üîß Future Enhancements
      - Add support for more AWS services.
      - Export results in **CSV/JSON format**.
      - Automate with **cron jobs** and send **email reports**.
      - Add **filtering options** (e.g., list only running EC2 instances).
